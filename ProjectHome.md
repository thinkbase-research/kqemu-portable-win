Ok, so I just threw this together, by making kqemu - the qemu accelarator portable.
The zip file is 6.2MB, unzipped its 15MB(with a 10MB base linux image). I just thought some people might find this useful to be able to boot into linux on windows off their usb drives. For more information on Qemu click <a href='http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/'>here</a>. You can find some great linux images to that it will run flawlessly from <a href='http://www.oszoo.org/wiki/index.php/Category:OS_images'>here</a>. Just edit the bat file by changing the img name to whatever you have downloaded.

Enjoy.
